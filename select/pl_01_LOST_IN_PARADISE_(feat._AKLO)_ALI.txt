Gotta get it homie gotta move it
If you gonna do it then
他二の次
Everybody just talk nobody
really do it
なんならやるまでしとけよ秘密に
誰かと確認なんて不要
自分のジャッジだけで
brake the walls
ド派手なfakeやろうより
Cool にlow にprove them wrong
I won’t give it up,
the fight in my life
Cause my life is living for love
I won’t give it up,
fighting my life
Stand off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I’m going to relight
your feeling
When times get too rough
Night and day are fading
I’m going to relight
your feeling
There’s no time to explain
Oh nothing is for real
That’s how you make me feel
I gotta beat
this stomping on love
Pick up my wasted time
God might understand
Nobody can hold me down
I won’t give it up,
fighting my life
Causе my life is living
for love
I won’t give it up,
fighting in my life
Stand off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I’m going to relight
your feeling
When times get too rough
Night and day are blending
I’m going to relight
your feeling
Light up every last one of them
またTime is Ticking
唯一平等Wasting No More
計画ならDoneするまでNot Real
The Illest　頂く称号
誰かの予想軽々超えてはるか向こう
I’ve done it
あれもこれもそれも
もしDownしてもupして On and On
東京Hellから Paradise
そりゃ勝ちとるためなら
Gotta Fight
今更やわなかけできるわけねぇだろ
ぶちかませ
頭の中から現実に
変換していく綿密に
眠らずAction　0時過ぎ
このLifeが生み出す芸術品
Oh nothing is for real
That’s how you make me feel
I gotta beat
this stomping on love
Pick up my wasted time
God might understand
Nobody can’t hold me down
I won’t give it up,
the fight in my life
'Cause my life is living
for love
I won’t give it up,
fightin' my life
Standing off and groove on time
Tokyo prison
I’m going to relight
your feeling
When times get too rough
Night and day are fading
I’m going to relight
your feeling
There’s no time to explain
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
When time gets rough
Access to your love
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
Keep on dancing now
Hey hey
Tokyo prison
I’m going to relight
your feeling
(ooh yeah, ooh yeah)
Night and day are fading
I’m going to relight
your feeling
Light up every last one of them
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
When times get too rough
Access to your love
Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
Keep on dancing now
Hey hey hey hey hey
