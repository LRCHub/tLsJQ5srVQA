Gotta get it homie gotta move it
If you gonna do it then 他二の次
Everybody just talk nobody really do it
なんならやるまでしとけよ秘密に
誰かと確認なんて不要
自分のジャッジだけでbreak the walls
ド派手なfakeやろうより
Coolにlowにprove them wrong

I won't give up the fight in my life
Cause my life is living for love
And I won't give up the fight in my life
Stand off and groove on time

Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling
When time gets rough
Night and day are fading
I'm going to relight your feeling
There's no time to explain

Oh nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I got beaten, stompin'on love
Pick up my wasted time
Oh god might understand
Nobody can't hold me down

I won't give up the fight in my life
Cause my life is living for love
And I won't give up the fight in my life
Stand off and groove on time

Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling
When time gets rough
Night and day are blending
I'm going to relight your feeling
Light up every last one of them

またTime is Ticking
唯一平等Wasting No More
計画ならDoneするまでNot Real
The Illest 頂く称号Yeah
誰かの予想 軽超えて はるか向こう
I've done it あれもこれもそれも
もしDownしてもupしてOn and On

東京HellからParadise
そりゃ勝ちとるためならGotta Fight
今更やわな かけ
できるわけねぇだろ ぶちかませ
頭の中から現実に
変換していく綿密に
眠らずAction 0時過ぎ
このLifeが生み出す 芸術品

Oh nothing is for real
That's how you make me feel
I got beaten, stompin'on love
Pick up my wasted time
Oh god might understand
Nobody can't hold me down

I won't give up the fight in my life
Cause my life is living for love
And I won't give up the fight in my life
Stand off and groove on time

Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling
When time gets rough
Night and day are fading
I'm going to relight your feeling
There's no time to explain

Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
When time gets rough
Access to your love

Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
Keep on dance now
Hey hey

Tokyo prison
I'm going to relight your feeling

Night and day are blending
I'm going to relight your feeling
Light up every last one of them

Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
When time gets rough
Access to your love

Lost in paradise
Night and day are fading out
Keep on dance now
Hey hey hey hey hey
